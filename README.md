## What is this?

Experience your website through the lens of visual, auditory, or mobility impairments

## How does it work?

- Flask as the web framwork
- Flask for handling http requests
- Python as the programming language
- Vercel for deployment

## Development

Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

```sh
# Install flask
python -m pip install flask

# If that doesn't work retry but replace `python` with `py`, then try `python3`, then try `py3`

# Clone the sources
git clone https://github.com/justindhillon/a11y

# Run the `index.py`

# Start the application at https://localhost:5000.
```

## Alternative method

You can also append the url at the end of the link and it will also work. (e.g if your server is running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` then you can go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/https://example.com` and it will read out the contents of `https://example.com`)
